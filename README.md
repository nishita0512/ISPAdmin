## Acknowledgements

**Libraries used:**

- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/): A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It handles all the conversions under the hood for request body and response request data.

- [OkHTTP](https://square.github.io/okhttp/): OkHttp perseveres when the network is troublesome: it will silently recover from common connection problems. If your service has multiple IP addresses, OkHttp will attempt alternate addresses if the first connect fails. This is necessary for IPv4+IPv6 and services hosted in redundant data centers.
