# Internet Service Provider Application

This App is an admin panel for [ISP](https://github.com/nishita0512/ISP) Application

**This App works along with my 2 other projects**:
1. [ISP](https://github.com/nishita0512/ISP): Main Consumer-End Application.
2. [ISP REST-API](https://github.com/nishita0512/ISP-API): A server for communication between Admin and User.

**Libraries used:**

- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/): A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It handles all the conversions under the hood for request body and response request data.

- [OkHTTP](https://square.github.io/okhttp/): OkHttp perseveres when the network is troublesome: it will silently recover from common connection problems. If your service has multiple IP addresses, OkHttp will attempt alternate addresses if the first connect fails. This is necessary for IPv4+IPv6 and services hosted in redundant data centers.
